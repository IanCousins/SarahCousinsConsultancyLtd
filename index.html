        <div class="about-item">
            <p>Sarah is a Management Consultant providing support to the NHS, having worked in the
                NHS in primary care for 25 years, both as a commissioner and as a front-line provider.</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="about-item">
            <p>She began her career as a Practice and Fundholding Manager in a first wave
                Fundholding Practice. In 1999, as Fundholding came to an end, she moved into commissioning, with
                responsibility for developing and commissioning primary, community and mental health services. She
                remained in that role until 2004, when she made the decision to move back to the coal face and returned
                to Practice Management in a 14,000-patient, forward-thinking and progressive first wave PMS Plus
                Practice.</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="about-item">
            <p>During Sarah’s 12 years at the practice, the town was one of the Department of
                Health’s Integrated Care Organisation Pilot sites. As part of this, she had the opportunity to lead work
                in a truly integrated way across primary and community care and see the positive impact that this had on
                patient care and outcomes, as well as the better and more efficient use of scarce resource.</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="about-item">
            <p>Sarah has also been a Director of a GP Federation, and through that role played a
                key part in developing the successful application to become one of 15 Rapid Test Sites for Primary Care
                Home, which is a multi-speciality community provider model of care.</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="about-item">
            <p>Sarah has always enjoyed participating in and delivering training. She worked with
                the then Northern Deanery to write and deliver a training manual to Practice Managers working in GP
                Training Practices. She has also had a regular slot on the local GP Vocational Training Scheme, where
                she had the opportunity to impart her wisdom on the business side of general practice to GP Registrars.

        <div class="about-item">
            <p>Sarah is innovative, financially astute and has excellent interpersonal skills. She
                understands the importance of getting to know people and what motivates them and this then helps her to
                get the best out of those she works with; managing change and resolving conflict and challenge. She is
                passionate about primary care and its importance in delivering high quality care and outcomes to
                patients.</p>

            <p>Since becoming a management consultant Sarah has continued to work at the sharp end
                of primary care service delivery, doing such as supporting practices to work at scale and develop back
                office function, primary care project assurance work, and delivering turn around and change management
                to practices struggling with the demands placed on them.</p>

                She has supported us in the development of our work force and in redressing the balance

                the long-term staffing issues and steered us through a challenging change process,
                improving communication at all levels. She leaves the practice in a stronger position
